# Django Project with WebRTC Integration

A Django web application with WebRTC functionality for real-time communication. This repository contains the Django backend, a minimal Node.js signaling server used for browser-to-browser connections, and front-end templates and static assets for demonstration and development.

## ‚ú® Features

- üõ† Django backend with user authentication and admin
- üìπ WebRTC integration for real-time video/audio communication (signaling via Node.js)
- üìÅ Course and notes management (create, update, delete)
- üñº Image upload support for course/profile assets
- üîê Example payment views and templates for demonstration

## üöÄ Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.6+
- Node.js (LTS version)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- Git

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sakib-Hossaine/DJANGO-Project.git
cd DJANGO-Project

2. Set up Python environment
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate (Windows)
venv\Scripts\activate
or conda activate ll2

# Activate (macOS/Linux)
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Set up Django
# Apply database migrations
python manage.py migrate

# Create admin user
python manage.py createsuperuser
# Follow prompts to create admin account

4. Set up WebRTC Node.js server
cd webrtc-node-app
npm install
node server.js

üèÉ Running the Project

Django Development Server:
python manage.py runserver

WebRTC Signaling Server (in separate terminal):
cd webrtc-node-app
node server.js
````

## Usage

After starting both servers (Django and the Node.js signaling server), open your browser and go to:

-  http://127.0.0.1:8000/ ‚Äî main Django site

The WebRTC pages are available from the courses or webrtc-related templates; the client code that connects to the signaling server lives under `webrtc-node-app/` and `templates/`.

Typical workflow:

1. Create an account or sign in using the Django auth pages.
2. Create or join a course/class from the `courses` section.
3. Use the provided WebRTC pages to start a call ‚Äî the browser client will connect to the Node.js signaling server (`webrtc-node-app/server.js`).

## Configuration

-  Django settings live in `MyProject/settings.py`. For local development, confirm `DEBUG = True` and that `ALLOWED_HOSTS` includes `localhost` if necessary.
-  Media files are stored in `media/` (course images, profile pics). The `MEDIA_ROOT` and `MEDIA_URL` settings control this.
-  The Node.js signaling server is in `webrtc-node-app/server.js` and listens on the port defined there (default: 3000). Update client-side connection URLs if you change the port.

## Running tests

This project includes some tests in the app folders (for example: `courses/tests.py`, `notes/tests.py`, `users/tests.py`). Run Django tests with:

```powershell
python manage.py test
```

Add or update tests as you modify behavior. Aim for small, focused unit tests for models and views.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. A simple workflow:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch (git checkout -b my-feature).
3. Make changes and add tests where relevant.
4. Run the test suite locally (python manage.py test).
5. Submit a pull request with a clear description of your changes.

Please follow these guidelines:

-  Keep changes focused and well-tested.
-  Use existing style and naming conventions in the project.
-  Don't commit secrets or production credentials.

## Development notes

-  Static assets are in `static/` and templates in `templates/`.
-  The Node.js signaling server is intentionally minimal for demo use. For production, consider adding authentication, HTTPS/WSS, and better error handling.

## Known issues

-  The WebRTC signaling server does not provide authentication out of the box ‚Äî use only for local development or behind a secure network.
-  Some templates and forms may be simplified for the course demo and can be hardened for production.

This project doesn't include an explicit license in the repository. If you plan to share or accept contributions, consider adding an open-source license (for example, MIT or Apache-2.0). Add a `LICENSE` file at the project root.
