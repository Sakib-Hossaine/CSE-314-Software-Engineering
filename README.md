üèÉ Running the Project

Django Development Server:
python manage.py runserver

WebRTC Signaling Server (in separate terminal):
cd webrtc-node-app
node server.js
````

## Usage

After starting both servers (Django and the Node.js signaling server), open your browser and go to:

-  http://127.0.0.1:8000/ ‚Äî main Django site

The WebRTC pages are available from the courses or webrtc-related templates; the client code that connects to the signaling server lives under `webrtc-node-app/` and `templates/`.

Typical workflow:

1. Create an account or sign in using the Django auth pages.
2. Create or join a course/class from the `courses` section.
3. Use the provided WebRTC pages to start a call ‚Äî the browser client will connect to the Node.js signaling server (`webrtc-node-app/server.js`).

## Configuration

-  Django settings live in `MyProject/settings.py`. For local development, confirm `DEBUG = True` and that `ALLOWED_HOSTS` includes `localhost` if necessary.
-  Media files are stored in `media/` (course images, profile pics). The `MEDIA_ROOT` and `MEDIA_URL` settings control this.
-  The Node.js signaling server is in `webrtc-node-app/server.js` and listens on the port defined there (default: 3000). Update client-side connection URLs if you change the port.

## Full functional sslecommerce

This project contains example payment-related views and templates; the following guidance outlines how to evolve it into a full, SSL-secured ecommerce flow ("sslecommerce") suitable for production.

Key components you'll want to implement or verify:

-  TLS/SSL termination

   -  Use a trusted certificate (Let's Encrypt, commercial CA) on your public endpoint. If you deploy behind a reverse proxy (Nginx, Traefik) or a PaaS (Heroku, Azure Web Apps), terminate TLS there and proxy traffic to Django over HTTP on the internal network.
   -  For local testing, use mkcert or a dev proxy supporting HTTPS to exercise secure cookie flags and secure WebSocket (wss://) connections for WebRTC.

-  Payment gateway integration

   -  Choose a PCI-compliant gateway (Stripe, PayPal, Razorpay, etc.). Use their official SDK/server-side libraries inside Django to create payment intents and verify webhooks.
   -  Keep all sensitive keys out of source control. Use environment variables (for example via a `.env` file loaded by `django-environ`) or your deployment platform's secret management.

-  Django settings for ecommerce

   -  SECURITY
      -  Set `SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT = True` (only after properly configuring SSL in production).
      -  Set `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True` and `CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = True` so cookies are only sent over HTTPS.
      -  Set `SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS` (e.g., 63072000) and other HSTS settings once you confirm HTTPS is stable.
   -  Payment credentials
      -  Place API keys in environment variables and reference them in `MyProject/settings.py` (or use `django-environ`).
   -  Webhook endpoints
      -  Create a dedicated endpoint to receive and verify gateway webhooks (verify signatures). Keep it behind HTTPS and, if possible, restrict access by IP or use gateway-supplied signatures.

-  Media and static files

   -  Serve static files via CDN or the web server (Nginx). For media (user uploads), use a managed object store (S3, Azure Blob) for scalability and security. Ensure proper file validation when accepting uploads.

-  Secure WebRTC signaling

   -  Serve the signaling channel over WSS (secure WebSocket) so browsers will use secure transport when loaded over HTTPS. If the Node.js signaling server is behind a reverse proxy, enable proxying of WSS.

-  Testing and verification

   -  Run Django tests (`python manage.py test`) and add integration tests for checkout and webhook processing.
   -  Use the gateway's test mode and sample webhooks to verify end-to-end flows.
   -  Manually verify cookie flags, redirect behavior, and that all payment flows reject invalid data.

-  Deployment checklist
   -  Use environment-specific settings (separate production settings file or env var overrides).
   -  Ensure DEBUG=False in production and that `ALLOWED_HOSTS` is set correctly.
   -  Configure monitoring and alerting for payment failures and webhook processing errors.
   -  Perform a small canary rollout and review logs for errors before promoting to full traffic.

Security note: Payment systems are high-risk and regulated (PCI). For production deployments, prefer using the gateway's hosted checkout pages or follow their recommended methods to minimize PCI scope. If you accept card data on your servers, ensure you follow all compliance steps or consult a payment expert.

## Running tests

This project includes some tests in the app folders (for example: `courses/tests.py`, `notes/tests.py`, `users/tests.py`). Run Django tests with:

```powershell
python manage.py test
```

Add or update tests as you modify behavior. Aim for small, focused unit tests for models and views.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. A simple workflow:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch (git checkout -b my-feature).
3. Make changes and add tests where relevant.
4. Run the test suite locally (python manage.py test).
5. Submit a pull request with a clear description of your changes.

Please follow these guidelines:

-  Keep changes focused and well-tested.
-  Use existing style and naming conventions in the project.
-  Don't commit secrets or production credentials.

## Development notes

-  Static assets are in `static/` and templates in `templates/`.
-  The Node.js signaling server is intentionally minimal for demo use. For production, consider adding authentication, HTTPS/WSS, and better error handling.

## Known issues

-  The WebRTC signaling server does not provide authentication out of the box ‚Äî use only for local development or behind a secure network.
-  Some templates and forms may be simplified for the course demo and can be hardened for production.

This project doesn't include an explicit license in the repository. If you plan to share or accept contributions, consider adding an open-source license (for example, MIT or Apache-2.0). Add a `LICENSE` file at the project root.
